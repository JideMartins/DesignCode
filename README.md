# DesignCode

 Design on Figma, reproduce in HTML and CSS.
 
 This is a personal journey to improve my coding skills. 
 As a Product Designer, it is crucial that I learn the basics of HTML and CSS, and maybe even JavaScript, to better collaborate with Developers.
 Understanding frameworks and their limitations and possibilities helps me to design more effectively and work better with developers. 
 Ultimately, this knowledge helps me to become a better designer.
